This [[http://jarjuk.github.io/sbuilder-timeoff-demo/index.html][Specification Driven Development Demo]] presents a realization of a
[[https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/specification-driven-development/#development-architecture][development architecture]] to help in managing IT on-line openness.

Particularly, it

- aims at pointing out, how /Specification Driven Development/ can be
  integrated with an existing legacy implementation
- puts forward design artifacts and how these artifacts are
  transferred from design step to another
- explains, how to setup development architecture supporting
  /Specification Driven Development/

The demo uses an existing application (=timeoff-management=) as a
target implementation. Only [[http://jarjuk.github.io/sbuilder-timeoff-demo/00-timeoff-demo.html][one simple interface]]
(=/registerCompany(post)=) is specified to keep focus on the factors
