companies need to <a href="https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2017/01/01/sbuilder-roadmap-v2-part1/#orgheadline3">manage their IT on-line openess</a> carefully to avoid
the <code>Risk of Unfortunate IT failures</code>.

<a href="https://github.com/jarjuk/sbuilder-timeoff-demo">Specification Driven Development</a>, with adequate <a href="https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/specification-driven-development/#development-architecture">development
architecture</a> and <a href="https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/specification-driven-development/#process">development process</a>, <a href="https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/specification-driven-development/#orgheadline1">could</a> help companies in managing
their IT on-line openess. As the <a href="https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/specification-driven-development/#orgheadline4">result</a>, expect better systems due to
understanding the problem better, getting the design right, and being
able to write better code. Particulary, in the context of this demo,
expect savings in test management, when using formal model to generate
API traces, which represent end-to-end scenarios executing across
system services in the formal model, and using these API traces to
create unit tests on implementation. Savings in test management are
realized, when, after executing each of the individual unit tests, the
aggregate result can be interpreted as an execution of a "virtual"
system test on the composite system - considerably easier than
managing the execution a system test as a single unit.

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Objective of the Specification Driven Development Demo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
This <code>Specification Driven Development Demo</code> presents a realization of
a <a href="https://jarjuk.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/specification-driven-development/#development-architecture">development architecture</a> to help in managing IT on-line openness.
</p>

<p>
Particularly, it
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>aims at pointing out, how <i>Specification Driven Development</i> can be
integrated with an existing legacy implementation</li>
<li>puts forward design artifacts and how these artifacts are
transferred from design step to another</li>
<li>explains, how to setup development architecture supporting
<i>Specification Driven Development</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
The demo uses an existing application (<code>timeoff-management</code>) as a
target implementation. Only <a href="00-timeoff-demo.html">one simple interface</a>
(<code>/registerCompany(post)</code>) is specified to keep focus on the factors
enabling <i>Specification Driven Development</i>.

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Overview of Specification Driven Development Demo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
The diagram below shows main architectural elemets corresponding
<i>Specification Driven Development</i> design steps:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="01-schema-and-api-design.html">Schema and API Design</a></li>
<li><a href="02-formal-modeling.html">Formal Modeling</a></li>
<li><a href="03-virtual-system-test.html">Virtual Systems Testing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The diagram depicts also, how <code>timeoff-management</code> -application, used
in this <code>Specification Driven Development Demo</code>, is retrived from a
<a href="https://github.com/timeoff-management/application">GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the diagram presents directory <code>../stage/</code>, which is used to
transfer design artifacts between design steps.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>timeoff-swagger.yaml</code>: specification of interface
<code>/registerCompany(post)</code> created in <i>Schema and API Design</i></li>
<li><code>API Trace</code>: Formal model execution traces created in <i>Formal
Modeling</i> deployed in the the form of self extracting archive files
to the staging directory</li>
</ul>
