Schema design creates /Logical Schema/ composed of /ER diagram/ and
/Entity/ definitions. In API design, /Logical Schema/ is mapped to an
/External Schema/ as =timeoff-swagger.yaml= using [[https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md][swagger 2.0]] format
of [[https://swagger.io/specification/][Open API specification]]. This API specification is deployed into the
staging directory =../stage=.
