Formal model is composed of /Application Model/, /Environment Setup/
and /Correctness/ criteria.  /Application Model/ is constructed using
TLA+ language /Specification Snippets/ and by translating API
specification, =timeoff-swagger.yaml= in =../stage= directory, to
/Formal Model Interfaces/. /Resolvers/ determine domains for formal
data model elements, with /Environment Setup Domains/ giving value
sets for the domains. /Environment Setup Steps/ define interface
messages environment sends to the /Application Model/. /Correctness/
criteria are used to verify that the /Formal Model/ meets the
specified requirements.

/Environment Setup/ may also have /Possibility/ operators, which are
used to generate /Model Checker Error Logs/ to demonstrate that
behavior given by the /Possibility/ operator exists in the /Formal
Model/. Configuration file /sbuilder.yaml/ combines all of the above
together and controls formal model generation.

/API Traces/, parsed from /Model Checker Error Logs/, are
deployed to =../stage= directory to be used as input to /Virtual
System Testing/.
