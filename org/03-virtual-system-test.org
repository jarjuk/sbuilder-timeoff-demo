=timeoff-management= application is downloaded to /Virtual System
Testing/ from /GitHub/ repository. /Api Trace/ archives are extracted

can access /Test Case Steps/, and make calls to /System Under Test/
(SUT) using /Lower Test/ interfaces, accesing and modifying SUT
persistent state, and /Upper Tester/, interfacing via API
request/response messages with the SUT.
